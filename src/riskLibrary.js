  "longevity": {
    title: "Longevity risk (outliving your savings)",
    plainEnglish: "If you live longer than expected, your money has to stretch further. The tricky bit is you don’t get to choose your lifespan—so you build a plan that can flex.",
    tryThis: "Stress test your plan to age 90–95. If it doesn’t hold up, consider a lower drawdown, a small cash buffer, or (later) a longevity product."
  },
  "sequencing": {
    title: "Sequencing risk (bad markets early in retirement)",
    plainEnglish: "Big market falls early in retirement can do more damage than the same falls later, because you’re withdrawing while markets are down.",
    tryThis: "Create a short‑term ‘income buffer’ (e.g., 1–3 years of payments) so you’re not forced to sell growth assets after a fall."
  },
  "inflation": {
    title: "Inflation risk (prices rise, your income buys less)",
    plainEnglish: "Even ‘low’ inflation compounds. Over 20 years, the cost of life can quietly moonwalk away from you.",
    tryThis: "Plan for your spending to increase over time. Consider keeping some growth exposure to help your income keep up."
  },
  "age pension": {
    title: "Age Pension risk & uncertainty",
    plainEnglish: "Eligibility depends on assets/income tests, and rules can change. Many retirees get a part pension—not all or nothing.",
    tryThis: "Get a rough Age Pension estimate and treat it as a range, not a guarantee. Build a plan that still works if it’s lower than expected."
  },
  "market": {
    title: "Market volatility (the emotional rollercoaster)",
    plainEnglish: "Markets move. The real risk is making a panicked decision at the wrong time, locking in losses or missing recoveries.",
    tryThis: "Pick an investment mix you can actually stick with. If you’re going to change anything, change it on a calm Tuesday—not a scary headline day."
  },
  "health": {
    title: "Health shock & care costs",
    plainEnglish: "A health event can hit both your expenses and your ability to manage money. It’s a double whammy if you don’t plan for it.",
    tryThis: "Keep an emergency buffer. Consider an enduring power of attorney and make sure your family knows where key info lives."
  },
  "cognitive": {
    title: "Cognitive decline & financial vulnerability",
    plainEnglish: "As people age, decision‑making can get harder—and scammers get bolder. Planning early is a gift to Future You.",
    tryThis: "Set up trusted contacts, put guardrails in place (e.g., account alerts), and document your wishes while it’s easy."
